# jlog-facade

This is a simple logger faÃ§ade that focusing on creating a JSON output for typescript projects.

## Usage

A [LoggerFactory](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/LoggerFactory.html) is used to create a new instance of a [JLogger](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/JLogger.html) which doesn't output any log until a log destination is set:

```ts
const logger = LoggerFactory.create('my-logger');

// or alternatively
const logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger('my-logger');
```

Note that `.getLogger` was created for compatibility with other logger classes but it is not strictly correct.  Every call to `.getLogger` will create a new instance of [JLogger](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/JLogger.html).  

To write a log entry, it works like any other logger:

```ts
logger.debug('This is a debug message');
logger.info(`Process started at port $PORT`);
logger.error('Failed to processing incoming request', err);
```

### Install

```
npm i jlog-facade
```

### Creating JSON Entry

To facilitate generation of JSON output, [JLogger](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/JLogger.html) accept [IJson](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/interfaces/IJson.html) as additional attributes to be added to the output:

```ts
logger.info('The process has started', {processId: 123456});
```

The log methods also support a callback method that would handle any potential error when generating the message.

```ts
logger.info(() => 'The process has started', {processId: 123456});
```

#### AbstractLoggable and AbstractKeyValue

Logger methods also accept an [AbstractLoggable](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/AbstractLoggable.html) which exposes `.toJson` method allowing any custom object to be written to the log.  All the entries are merged before the log and by default, duplicated keys are resolved by first key having priority over any subsquent keys.

[AbstractKeyValue](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/AbstractKeyValue.html) is an implementation of [AbstractLoggable](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/AbstractLoggable.html) that creates a simple key/value pair object where value can be any data type.  A sample implementation is [KV](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/KV.html) which enforces the value to be instance of [TLoggableValue](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/types/TLoggableValue.html):

```ts
logger.info('The process has started', KV.of('processId', 123456), new KV.of('processId', 888));
```

The value of the `processId` key in above example is `123456` as it's the first value set.

#### Label

Another built-in [AbstractLoggable](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/AbstractLoggable.html) is [Label](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/Label.html) that allow caller to pass a key and one or more values.  Please note that value of the [Label](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/Label.html) is always a list, even if only one value is passed to the constructor.  The duplicate keys of [Label](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/Label.html) passed are merged instead of overwriten:

```ts
logger.info('The process has started', Label.of('processId', 123456), Label.of('processId', 888));
```

The value of the `processId` key in above example is `[123456, 888]`.

#### Loggable

A [Loggable](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/Loggable.html) is a special implementation of [AbstractLoggable](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/AbstractLoggable.html) that accept any data type as value.  However, if value passed contains any attributes that cannot be processed by `JSON.stringify()`, the result will be a string of `[object Object]`.  As result, it's recommend the use of [KV](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/KV.html) instead.

```ts
logger.info('The process has started', Loggable.of('date', new Date('2023-03-24')));
```

The value of the `date` key in above example would be `2023-03-24T00:00:00.000Z`.


### Log Destination

2 simple destinations are available in this package:

1. [SimpleJsonDestination](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/SimpleJsonDestination.html)
1. [SimpleTextDestination](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/SimpleTextDestination.html)

The class above serve mostly for debug or test purposes.  It is expected that a separate platform specific destination is used in an actual project.  A log destination really is just a formatter for a [IJLogEntry](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/interfaces/IJLogEntry.html) and [LoggerFactory](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/LoggerFactory.html).  It accepts 3 type of log destination:

1. A synchronous class that extends [AbstractLogDestination](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/AbstractLogDestination.html)
1. An asynchronous class that extends [AbstractAsyncLogDestination](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/AbstractAsyncLogDestination.html)
1. An instance of [Writable](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#class-streamwritable) stream

If one must ensure that last async log has been written, the following promise can be used: 

```ts
await logger.logWritten();
```

#### Usage

At starting point of your application, add desire destinations using A [LoggerFactory](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/LoggerFactory.html):

```ts
SimpleJsonDestination.use();

// or

LoggerFactory.addLogDestination(new SimpleJsonDestination());
```

#### Log Interceptor

Log destination allow you to add a log interceptor by calling `setLogInterceptor`:

```js
SimpleTextDestination.use(LogLevel.DEBUG).setLogInterceptor((entry: IJLogEntry, loggerLevel?: LogLevel, defaultPayload?: IJson) => {
  // Do something with log entry
});
```

This is often used by unit testing to ensure that correct data are logged.

#### Creating Your Own Log Destination

You should be able to create your own version of Log Destination [AbstractLogDestination](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/AbstractLogDestination.html).  However, you must make sure that:

1. Do create a `public static use` method so that all Log Destination follow the same interface
1. You must call `._write(entry, loggerLevel, defaultPayload)` in your `.write` method to ensure that log interceptor works
1. Use [safeStringify](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/functions/safeStringify.html) instead of `JSON.stringify` to address
   error that would result from logging an object with circular reference.

### Configuration

A `logger.json` can be placed under `./etc/${FP8_ENV}/logger.json` or `./config/${FP8_ENV}/logger.json` with the following content:

```jsonc
{
  // This is default logger level
  "severity": "info",

  // This overrides the log level for a specific loggerName
  "logger": {
    "my-logger": "debug"
  },

  // This overrides the logger name filter for a destination
  "destination": {
    "TestSimpleTextDestination": {
      "severity": "warn",
      "filters": ["test-zEd7efJ0Pr"]
    }
  }
}
```

The configuration set in `logger.json` override what's done in code.  The next level of setting is using destination:

```typescript
// Only write .warn logs
SimpleJsonDestination.use(LogLevel.WARNING);

// Only output log if logger is 'my-logger-A' or 'logger-B'
SimpleJsonDestination.use('my-logger-A', 'logger-B');

// Only output log if logger is 'my-logger' and if level is ERROR or above
SimpleJsonDestination.use(LogLevel.ERROR, 'my-logger');
```

The level can also be set by upon logger creation but this is not recommended as it should really be set in the `logger.json` or in a destination.

```typescript
const logger = LoggerFactory.create('my-logger', LogLevel.ERROR);
```

The content of the loaded `logger.json` can be accessed via [LoggerFactory.loadedConfig](https://fp8.github.io/jlog-facade/classes/LoggerFactory.html#loadedConfig) property.

#### Local vs deployed logger

It's often difficult to read json when doing local development.  The `logger.json` configuration allows you to enable multiple logger and activate a specific
logger for given env.  To accomplish this, set multiple destination as desired but set those destination using `LogLevel.OFF`:

```typescript
SimpleTextDestination.use(LogLevel.OFF);
SimpleJsonDestination.use(LogLevel.OFF);
```

Add the following `logger.json` to activate only the `SimpleTextDestination`:

```json
{
    "destination": {
        "SimpleTextDestination": {
            "severity": "info"
        }
    }
}
```

## Why Another Facade?

Working with project in both Kotlin and Typescript, I have come to miss the abstraction allowed by [slf4j](https://www.slf4j.org/) in the JVM world.  Another challenge I face is the need to produce a JSON based output for cloud service provider.

The problem above is simple to address on a project by project basis but it becomes an complicated mess when trying to create reusable components.

The objectives of `jlog-facade` are therefore:

1. A focus on creating a JSON log without requiring all log entry to be a JSON
1. A simple way to create a log destination without need to change the core library
1. Typescript centric implementation
